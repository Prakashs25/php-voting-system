# PHP - MYSQL Voting System

#### This Project was developed by me as a part of my academic course.
<br />
Download or clone the repository and place in your local server directory - WAMP or XAMPP

Create a database with name  `votedb` and import the code from the file `votedb tables.sql` in assets folder of this project

Go to your browser and navigate to project directory

Deafult Admin Crendentails :<br />

UserName : `admin`<br />
Password : `admin@123`<br />

Deafult Users Crendentails : 

USER - 1<br />

UserName : `user1`<br />
Password : `user1`<br />

USER - 2<br />

UserName : `user2`<br />
Password : `user2`<br />

There are 6 default users with same username and password pattern.
Adding New Users is possible by Admin.

Features: 

1. Admin can add new users, new candidates and also reset the database to Initial Stage(as if voting never happened)
2. Users can login and vote their candidates.
3. Users will be able to see results only if they have voted already. if not voted yet, the result button will be hidden.

### I don't work on this project anymore. But it can be improved a lot by adding more features.
